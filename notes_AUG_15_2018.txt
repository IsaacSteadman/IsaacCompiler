around line 4800, remove code in `compile_var_init`
put the constructor overload resolver in something like SingleVarDecl
put the expression form of the constructor in a new expression type (separate from FnCallExpr) and do overload
  resolution at the time of processing/building the expression

then for member functions to do overload resolution
  is trivial, the this pointer is inserted into the list of argument types

overloaded operator resolution is more difficult,
  it will one of the following
    a) that you try member functions using the 'this' pointer to class-type
       and then try all the global operators using a reference to class-type
    b) that you manipulate/map the list of global operator functions from first argument which is class-type reference
       to functions with first argument is class-type pointer
    c) that you manipulate/map the list of member operator functions from first argument (implicit this) which is class-type pointer
       to functions with first argument is a class-type reference
